#### *Growth Mindset*
Growth Mindset is when you tell yourself that you can accomplish any goal that you set, but you have to be willig to put the work into overcome whatever obstacles come your way.  
A few tips for me to stay in a growth  mindset are:
1.  Look at a problem from a different perspective.
2.   Use your resources.  Ask for help.
3.  Remember the power of YET.  
    -  I can't do this yet.  
    -  If I keep working on it I will eventually accomplish my goal, even if it takes a long time.
